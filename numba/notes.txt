Notes on timings of different numba approaches
size = 20 temp = 0.65

Base time = 8.350183

njit one_energy() : 3.280734 speed-up: 2.5452

njit para all_energy() + njit one_energy() : 5.175300 speed-up: 1.6135

njit one_energy() + njit get_order() : 1.47242 speed-up: 5.6711

jit MC_step() : N/A Doesn't work due to the large inlcusion of the np methods
